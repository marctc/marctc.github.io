      <description>Hi,
My old site was a little bit abandoned and hard to update so I decided to renew it.
For this time, I decided to use a static site generator so I gave a chance to Hugo. I never tried before but I discovered that it has its own themes site which is awesome as saves you a lot of customization time. By the way, if you wonder what template I&amp;rsquo;m using is the Cocoa enhanced theme.</description>

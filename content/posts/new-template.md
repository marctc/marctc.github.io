title: New template for the site
---

For a long time I wanted to update my bio, I joined Grafana 2 years ago and I didn't update yet..._Good Ol' Obsolescence_ made the current version of Hugo be incompatible with the previous theme, so I had to update it.

This time I used [congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) which has some nice features like dark mode. I also added a GitHub action to deploy the site to GitHub pages. Before I had two different repos, one for the source code and another for the generated site.
